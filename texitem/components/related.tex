Constructive Networks are a type of neural network which can modify their architecture while training. Cascade correlation Network was introduced in 1990 ~\cite{CascadeCorrelation1990}. The constructive architecture was designed to extract features by adding correlated neurons. Since the hidden neurons have weights frozen once added, the performance may be bad due to early poor neurons~\cite{CASPER1997}. Casper was introduced to solve this by setting leaky learning rate for frozen weights. However, both Cascade correlation and Casper network still suffer from accuracy drops while adding neurons. In this article a new training pipeline is introduced to improve the training loss while training and the final test results.
