The Constructive Cascade Networks~\cite{GeneralisationConstructiveCascade2009} are flexible and expressive deep learning algorithms especially on real-world complex tasks. However, they can suffer from performance drop after modifying the architecture of the network during training. Therefore, in this article we propose a improved training pipeline for Casper Network~\cite{CascadeCorrelation1990}, Conditional VAE-Casper algorithm to classify several real-world diseases by few physiological indicators and analyse the stable performance of CVAE-Casper during training. We will give out experimental results and analyse the improvements compared to the vanilla Casper Network, the advantages and drawbacks of CVAE-Casper. Finally, We will talk about the possible improvements of CVAE-Casper to explore future works.
